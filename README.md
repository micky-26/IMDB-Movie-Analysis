# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
A case study done on the 1000 movies list

For this project I have used dataset from kaggle 'IMDB-Movie-Data.csv'. It contains features like Title, Genre, Description, Director, Rating etc.

Firstly, I have loaded all the necessary libraries. Then loaded the data using panda.
In this project I will visualize different insights like classify movies based on Ratings[Excellent,Good and Average], find average rating of movies year-wise, display top 10 highest revenue movie titles etc.
